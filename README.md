# TurboClone
Following the [Alexandre Ruban](https://hotrails.podia.com/view/courses/rebuilding-turbo-rails/1408793-rails-plugins-architecture/4367442-creating-our-turbo-clone-rails-engine)'s Rebuilding Turbo Rails gem.

## Usage
I believe once completed you should simply be able to include this in your rails application's gemfile. The functionality will be similar to if not exactly that of the [Turbo Rails gem](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/turbo-rails/1.4.0)

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile: 

```ruby
gem "turbo_clone"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install turbo_clone
```

## Contributing
Contribution directions go here.

## License
The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
